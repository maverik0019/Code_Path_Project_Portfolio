We will look at a database from a fictional bookstore. \n","\n","First we will use some simple queries to get a feel for the structure and meaning of the different tables and columns. After which we will join two tables together to create insights we could otherwise not get. First with a basic join, then building on top of the simple join using `group by` and `count`.
